## 📝 Reflection on AI Tools in Development

The integration of AI tools significantly accelerated our development process. GitHub Copilot provided intelligent code suggestions that reduced boilerplate writing time by approximately 40%. Cursor's AI-powered editing capabilities helped identify potential bugs and suggest optimizations early in the development cycle. The AI service itself, built with Hugging Face transformers, demonstrates how machine learning can enhance user experience through intelligent question generation and transparency scoring.

Our architecture was guided by principles of transparency, scalability, and user trust. The microservice approach ensures that the AI components can scale independently while maintaining clean separation of concerns. The design prioritizes accessibility and mobile responsiveness, recognizing that transparency information should be available to all users regardless of their device or abilities. The product transparency logic emphasizes evidence-based scoring and contextual question generation, ensuring that the platform provides genuinely useful insights for ethical decision-making.
